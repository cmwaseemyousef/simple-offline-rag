RAG is often implemented with embeddings and a vector database. However, TF-IDF remains a strong baseline:

Pros of TF-IDF:
- Simple and fast to build locally
- No external API required
- Transparent term-based matching

Limitations:
- Misses semantic matches that use different words
- Requires preprocessing for performance on large corpora

This demo uses TF-IDF to stay offline-first and easy to understand.
